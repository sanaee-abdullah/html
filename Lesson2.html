<h2>Lesson 2 </h2>
<h2>Getting started with HTML</h2>
<p>HTML doesn't need any special editor to code. You can use Notepad if you are using Windows
or TextEdit if you're using a Mac.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the following instructions to understand the procedure, which is also
depicted in the screenshots accompanying it:</p>
<p>1. Open Notepad on your Windows PC. Write or paste your code in the Notepad file:</p>11

<p>2. Save the file in the (filename).html format. In this example, we will be using
Demo as the filename. Make sure that <b>Save as type</b> displays <b> All Files</b>:</p>

<p>3. When you go the location where you saved the file, you will see the Demo.html file:</p>
<p>4. After opening the Demo.html file, you will see the following screen. Voila! You have
executed your first piece of HTML code.</p>12
Instead of wasting time on theoretical discussions, let's get straight to coding so that you get
to grips with HTML.
The tutorials on HTML on the Internet usually contain a lot of clutter, where
you have redundant tags for formatting and styling. However, the correct
procedure is to keep the presentation separate from the content. Therefore,
all the presentational HTML elements and attributes were replaced by
CSS to provide versatility and better accessibility. Thus, we will gain an
understanding of the HTML essentials that are used frequently, keeping
in sync with the times. Also, to learn CSS, you can refer to my free Kindle
version book, Thinking on CSS, Packt Publishing, on Amazon at: http://

HTML is a markup language and includes a set of markup tags. Basically, an HTML
document has HTML tags and content. Let's have a look at the following code and
understand its structure:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<p> Welcome to Packt </p>
<p> Packt Lessons </p>
</body>
</html>
In the preceding code sample, <!Doctype html> is a declaration and lets the browser know
that you are using HTML5. In HTML, tags are keywords surrounded by angular brackets (<
>). They usually come in pairs. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the
closing tag. Similarly, <p> is the opening tag and </p> is the closing tag. The <html> tag tells
the browser that everything between it and the closing </html> tag is an HTML document.
The tags between <html> and </html> are also called elements. The tags do not get
displayed in the browser; instead, they determine the manner in which content is presented to
the user. The text between the <body> and </body> tags is the content that is presented to
the user. The <p> tag is used to define paragraphs where you want to break up two streams of
information. However, there is an exception to the rule; some tags such as <br> and <hr> do
not have a closing tag. Let's look at the output of the preceding code:13
We will gradually increase the level of difficulty with each code example so that you
understand the concepts in a lucid and practical manner.
