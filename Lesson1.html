<h2>Lesson 1 </h2>
<h2>Thinking in HTML </h2>
<p>HTML originated from a prototype created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992. Berners-Lee felt that
there was a possibility of linking documents together by the use of hypertext, and the concept
of HTML evolved. The drawback was that the commercial hypertext packages available at that
time, such as Zog and Intermedia, were customized to suit different types of computers and
were too ambiguous in nature.</p>
<p>Berners-Lee developed HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and in conjunction, he
developed a protocol to access text from other documents via hyperlinks. The protocol was
called HTTP, and this paved the way for the future. HTML itself was derived from a markup
language called Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).</p>
<p>Standardization being an ongoing process, modifications were constantly made and
versions were released accordingly. The various versions of HTML that have been released
are as follows:</p>
f HTML 2.0 (November 1995)
f HTML 3.2 (January 1997)
f HTML 4.0 (December 1997)
f HTML 4.01 (December 1999)
f HTML5, which is widely used, but is still in the development stage
Another breakthrough in the field was the introduction of CSS along with HTML 4.0. Prior to
the introduction of CSS, web designers and developers used HTML for formatting purposes.
Formatting and styling a web page using HTML defeats the purpose of HTML, because HTML
elements and attributes must only define the structure of the web page. The purpose of CSS
was to separate styling out from structural markup. With the introduction of CSS, we could
separate presentation from content. As a result, formatting could be separated from the HTML
document and stored in a separate file, which could then be included in the document using a
link tag.

Instead of wandering through loads of theory, we will understand HTML practically with
the help of code examples in this book. We have used Notepad for the examples in this
book. Alternatively, you can also use Notepad++ or any advanced editor such as Adobe
Dreamweaver. To execute the code, all you need to do is copy the code and paste it into
Notepad. Upon execution, you will get the output as depicted in the screenshots. Coding gets
better with practice. Instead of using the verbatim code in the book, you can alter the code
and see the change in the output to understand HTML better.
At the time of writing this book, HTML 4.0 is supported by most of the
browsers. This means that you can execute the code in major browsers such
as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. However, when
we move on to HTML5, this might not be the case. HTML5 is still in the
development stage and is expected to be released later this year. After HTML5
is accepted as the norm, it will be standardized and supported by all major
browsers. Browser support for the forms and attributes in HTML5 is explained
in detail at http://www.wufoo.com/html5/. This also indicates which
browsers are supporting which features and to what degree.
